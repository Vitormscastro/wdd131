                        <p class="mb-4">Born on March 21, 1960, in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, Ayrton Senna began karting at age 13. His natural talent quickly became evident as he dominated the karting scene, winning numerous championships.</p>  
                        <p class="mb-4">In 1981, Senna moved to England to pursue single-seater racing, winning the British Formula Ford 1600 championship. His meteoric rise continued through Formula Ford 2000 and British Formula Three, where he showcased his exceptional skill, particularly in wet conditions.</p>  
                        <p>His Formula 1 debut came in 1984 with Toleman, where he immediately impressed by finishing 6th in his first race and securing a remarkable 2nd place in the rain-soaked Monaco Grand Prix.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4">Senna's move to McLaren in 1988 marked the beginning of his most successful period in Formula 1. Partnered with Alain Prost, he won his first World Championship that year, securing 8 wins and 13 pole positions in 16 races.</p>  
                        <p class="mb-4">His rivalry with Prost defined an era of Formula 1, with both drivers pushing each other to new heights. Senna secured additional championships in 1990 and 1991, establishing himself as one of the sport's greatest drivers.</p>  
                        <p>His qualifying performances were particularly legendary, with a record 65 pole positions. Senna's mastery in wet conditions earned him the nickname "Rain Master," with some of his most memorable drives coming in challenging weather.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4">His tragic accident during the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix led to significant improvements in Formula 1 safety standards. His death marked a turning point in the sport's history, resulting in major changes that have saved countless lives.</p>  
                        <p>Senna's legacy lives on through his three World Championships, 41 race wins, 65 pole positions, and most importantly, through the millions of lives he continues to impact through his institute and the values he embodied: determination, technical excellence, and humanitarian spirit.</p>
